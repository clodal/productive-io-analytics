## 📇 About The Project

In my journey as a developer, I noticed that there wasn't a straightforward way to visualize sprints and task metrics from Productive.io without downloading bulky software or going through numerous steps.

That's why I decided to create Productive.io Analytics - a **free, open-source, login-less, and secure** way to visualize your sprints and tasks. All it takes is your Productive.io API keys, and you'll get access to your sprint dashboard complete with task statistics and a burndown chart. The best part? Your API keys are never saved - they're only stored on the client side for your security. 🔥
